# Comparative Analysis of DNN Architectures Using Black Box Attack Dataset

### Abstract
The move towards smart grid systems and interconnection through the Internet of Things has led to the digitization of critical power infrastructure without concurrent security enhancements, increasing power grid vulnerability to cyberattacks. This paper evaluates three convolutional neural network architectures — Base CNN, ResNet50 v2, and VGG16 — for detecting black box attacks on Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) data. Using a dataset of power grid disturbances represented as 300x20x3 images, we assess each model's accuracy, stability, and generalization capabilities. Our results indicate that while Base CNN achieves high accuracy with lower computational requirements, ResNet50 v2 offers superior stability and generalization, and VGG16 provides strong feature extraction despite higher parametrization. These findings contribute to developing more robust security measures for Wide Area Monitoring, Protection, and Control (WAMPAC) systems against sophisticated cyber threats.
